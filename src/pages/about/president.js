            Welcome to the College of Science, Technology and Applied Arts of
            Trinidad and Tobago. At COSTAATT, we are strongly committed to the
            principle of 'transforming lives, transforming communities and
            transforming the nation …one student at a time’. Inherent in our
            institutional philosophy and a key component of our educational
            thrust is a commitment to community service. Now, more than ever,
            our nation requires a highly educated workforce comprising citizens
            who understand the need for quality public services and lifelong
            learning as two of the hallmarks of a vibrant economy and
            sustainable development. COSTAATT offers courses of study that lead
            to certificates, diplomas, associate degrees and bachelor’s degrees.
            With campuses and Learning Centres located in Chaguanas, Port of
            Spain, El Dorado, Sangre Grande, San Fernando and Tobago, we are
            continually developing programmes and initiatives to meet the needs
            of the various sectors that we serve. At COSTAATT, we recognise that
            globalisation is shrinking our world and we are, therefore,
            committed to preparing our students to compete in the global
            knowledge economy, by stimulating them to use their minds, to become
            critical thinkers, decision makers and leaders of their respective
            communities.
