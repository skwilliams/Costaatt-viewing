Since COSTAATT's inception, more than 23 years ago and its continued commitment to producing qualified and competent health care professionals, this global strategy further supports and gives impetus to widening the nursing and allied health training at the College. Through continuous feedback form stakeholders, the School is able to revise its curricula to ensure that its graduates meet the needs of the employers and users of the health care system. We can achieve the above through collaboration as a team. The School's team consists of past and current practitioners in the fields of nursing and allied health. The COSTAATT team exposes you to the course material, the laboratory sessions, the simulation sessions, and internship sessions, and at the same time developing soft skills and general education through our core curriculum. My role as Dean is to ensure that your experience at the COSTAATT is a rewarding one and that you successfully achieve your educational goals.
